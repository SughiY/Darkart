# Darkart: Python Interface User's Guide

# Build

I haven't prepared the makefile yet, so it will need some manual settings.

First, compile Python.h file with gcc to make a shared object (.so) file.

Just like in https://github.com/guenchi/Darkart/blob/master/c/py.c 

Compile with `cc -fPIC -shared -framework Python -o ../py.so py.c`

Note that depending on the system, you may need to manually specify the path to `python.h`.

For me, with my mac it just:

py.c: `<#include  <Python/Python.h>`

In other cases:

py.c: `#include "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/include/python3.5m/Python.h"`

or

py.c: `#include "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/Python.h"`

etc.

Note that python belongs to a framework on mac, so with `-framework` when run cc command, in other cases, just: `cc -fPIC -shared -o ../py.so py.c`


# Definition:

`*po` representing a pointer to a Python Object reference.

Most of Py-call procedure accept or return a `*po`, in Scheme level, it's a memory address which is pointer a specific Python Object.

In the programme Py-call, the Class, the Method, the Number, all of it is `*po`. In other words, we just pass the memory address in Scheme level. 

This fits the philosophy of Scheme: "Parameter passing is by value, but the values are references."

This is also why the python library we call via the chez scheme is efficient than via the pythonï¼šWe just pass some pointer via binary interface, no extra overheadr.

When you write a code with Py-call, keep all the values in type of *po, don't convert it into scheme data until get the final result.

In this document, *po may be followed by the type of Python object it points to, like: *po<number>, *po<list,tuple> etc.

And *po{value} means a `*po` point to this value.

# Py-call

Library `(darkart py call)`

### Py-init and Py-fin

`(py-init)` and `(py-fin)` is the alias of `(py-initialize)` and `(py-finalize)`.
 
The codes which manipulating the python library must between `(py-init)` and `(py-fin)`.

Note that you can use it only on time, or you risk to get a 

`Exception: invalid memory reference.  Some debugging context lost`

If you want to write a library which wrap some Python Library, you don't have to use `(py-init)` and `(py-fin)` in the library code. like: https://github.com/guenchi/numpy/blob/master/numpy.sc


### Python Library

The library has to install, for exemple via Pip, before darkart call it.

You can go to python envirement do something like `import numpy` to test it.

```scheme
procedure: (py-import libraryName)

return: *po
```

Don't forget store the memory addres that procedure return, like:
```scheme
(define np (py-import numpy))
```

To repackage a Library to Scheme, there is a Exemple:
https://github.com/guenchi/numpy/blob/master/numpy.sc

### Point

```scheme
procedure: (py-get *po Name)

return: *po
```
This is the point syntax of Python.
Like:

```scheme
(define array (py-get np array))      = numpy.array

(define pi (py-get np pi))            = numpy.pi
```

### Function

```scheme
procedure: (py-call *po<callable> args ...)

return: *po
```

Exemple:
```scheme
(py-call array (list->py-list 'int '(1 2 3 4 5)))
=> *op{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}

(define np-array
    (lambda (x)
        (py-call array x)))

(np-array (list->py-list 'int '(1 2 3 4 5)))
=> *op{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
```

There is a helper to generate a procedure with *po<callable>:

```scheme
procedure: (py-func *po<callable>)

return: *po<function>
```

Exemple:
```scheme
(define np-array (py-func array))

(np-array (list->py-list 'int '(1 2 3 4 5)))
=> *op{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
```

Some python function need named arguments, use:

```scheme
procedure: ((py-call* *po<callable> args ...) alistOfNamedArgs)

return: *po
```
The alist is like: `'(("Name" . *po) ...)`

Exemple:
```scheme
((py-call* array (list->py-list 'int '(1 2 3 4 5)))
    `(('dtype . ,(str "float"))))
=> *op{[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]}

(define-syntax np-array
    (syntax-rules ()
        ((_ e)(py-call *array e))
        ((_ e (k v) ...)
            ((py-call* *array e) 
                (list (cons k v) ...)))))

(np-array (list->py-list 'int '(1 2 3 4 5)))
=> *op{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}

(np-array (list->py-list 'int '(1 2 3 4 5)) ('dtype (str "float")))
=> *op{[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]}
```

There is also a helper to generate a procedure which need named argument with *po<callable>:

```scheme
procedure: (py-func* *po<callable>)

return: *po<function>
```

Exemple:
```scheme
(define np-array (py-func* array))

((np-array 
    (list->py-list 'int '(1 2 3 4 5)))
    `(('dtype . ,(str "float"))))
=> *op{[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]}
```

Args helpers:
```scheme
procedure: (py-args *po ...)

procedure: (py-args* '(*po ...))

return: *po<tuple>
```
This procedure is use to prepare a tuple of arguments for Python's function. 
It usually won't be used directly because it's included in `(py-call)`,`(py-call*)`,`(py-func)`and`(py-func*)`.

### Number and String

```scheme
procedure: (int number)

procedure: (float number)

procedure: (str number)

return: *po<number,string>
```

Covert a Scheme data to Python data.

Exemple:
```scheme
(int 8)                       => *po{8}

(float 3.1415926)             => *po{3.1415926}

(str "foo")                   => *po{"foo"}
```

```scheme
procedure: (py->int *po<number>)

return: number<int>

procedure: (py->float *po<number>)

return: number<float>

procedure: (py->str *po<string>)

return: string
```

Covert a Python data to Scheme data.

Exemple:
```scheme
(py->int (int 8))                => 8

(py->float (float 3.1415926))    => 3.1415926

(py->str (str "foo"))            => "foo"
```

### List and Tuple

```scheme
procedure: (list->py-list* listOf*Po)

procedure: (list->py-tuple* listOf*Po)

procedure: (vector->py-list* vectorOf*Po)

procedure: (vector->py-tuple* vectorOf*Po)

procedure: (list->py-list type list)

procedure: (list->py-tuple type list)

procedure: (vector->py-list type vector)

procedure: (vector->py-tuple type vector)

return: *po<list,tuple>
```

Covert a Scheme's List and Vector to Python's List and Tuple.

The type will be: 'int 'float or 'str.

Exemple:
```scheme
(list->py-list 'int '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8))

(list->py-list* `(,(int 1) ,(int 2) ,(int 3)))

(vector->py-list* `#(,(int 1) ,(float 3.14159) ,(str "foo")))
```
Attention that if don't specific list / vector's type, you have to covert data to *po before make list / vector.

```scheme
procedure: (py-list->list type *po<list>)

procedure: (py-tuple->list type *po<tuple>)

return: list

procedure: (py-list->vector type *po<list>)

procedure: (py-tuple->vector type *po<tuple>)

return: vector

procedure: (py-list->list* *po<tuple>)

procedure: (py-tuple->list* *po<tuple>)

return: list of *po

procedure: (py-list->vector* *po<list>)

procedure: (py-tuple->vector* *po<tuple>)

return: vector of *po
```

Exemple:
```scheme
(py-list->list 'int (list->py-list 'int '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)))
=> (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)

(py-list->list* (list->py-list* `(,(int 1) ,(float 3.14159) ,(str "foo"))))
=> (*po{1} *po{3.14159} *po{"foo"})
```
In last case it return a list of Memory Adresse of *po. You can use (py->int), (py->float) or (py-str) to convert it to Scheme Data.

Like:
```scheme
(py->int (car (py-list->list* (list->py-list* `(,(int 1) ,(float 3.14159) ,(str "foo"))))))
=> 1

(py->float (cadr (py-list->list* (list->py-list* `(,(int 1) ,(float 3.14159) ,(str "foo"))))))
=> 3.14159

(py->str (caddr (py-list->list* (list->py-list* `(,(int 1) ,(float 3.14159) ,(str "foo"))))))
=> "foo"
```

### Numeric Operations

```scheme
procedure: (py-add *po *po)

procedure: (py-sub *po *po)

procedure: (py-mul *po *po)

procedure: (py-div *po *po)

procedure: (py-fdiv *po *po)

procedure: (py-mod *po *po)

procedure: (py-lsh *po *po)

procedure: (py-rsh *po *po)

procedure: (py-and *po *po)

procedure: (py-or *po *po)

procedure: (py-xor *po *po)

procedure: (py-inv *po)

procedure: (py-abs *po)

procedure: (py-neg *po)

return: *po
```

*po in here may be a number or a list, tuple, array(numpy) of number.

Exemple:
```scheme
(py-add (int 3) (int 5))                            => *po{8}

(py-mul (int 8) (list->py-list int' '(1 2 3 4 5)))  => *po{[8, 16, 24, 32, 40]}

(py-abs (int -5))                                   => *po{5} 
```
